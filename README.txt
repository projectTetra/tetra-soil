tetra-soil
==========

This repository maintains a copy of the Simple OpenGL Image Library.

The library was initially Public Domain, and still is.
The original is available at: http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
The only difference between this version and the lonesock version is the soil_test (not present here) and
the SCons build script.
